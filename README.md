# Safe_Room

The idea for the "Safe Room" arose when I constantly forgot the lights go on and the house dungeon .. Just as I leave the fireplace unattended always ..

So I opted for a "system" which to me indicates whether the fireplace is still "on", or whether the light is still burning in one room.

ToDo :

1) Create Script for Mobile Phone,MS Band and alerting when leaving the apartment .
2) Push a alert Note to Mobile .
3) Create a Case with 3D Printer
